note("The unit of observation is firm i at year y. Robust standard errors, adjusted for clustering by firm in permno. The dependent variable is log equivalent price-dividend ratio for firm i at year y. Coastalstate is an indicator equal to 1 if the firm's headquarter is located in a coastal state, and equal to 0 otherwise. Topeightstate is an indicator equal to 1 if the firmâ€™s headquarter is located in either Georgia, Connecticut, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Jersey, or Florida which were the top 8 states that had a decrease in real estate value from sea-level. Macro Controls include log equivalent GDP, Inflation and Real interest rate all for a given year y. Firm Controls include total intangible assets, long term debt, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenditure, and capital expenditure all denominated by total assets at a given year y at quarter q for a firm i. The samples include all companies cross-listed on CRSP and Compustat from 1993 January to 2013 December. The significance level of the coefficients are denoted as follows: *5% **1% ***0.1%")
